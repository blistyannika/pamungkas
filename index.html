            <p>Pamungkas ( pronounced: pah-mung-kah-s ) is an Indonesian singer-songwriter and music producer. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist, he began his musical journey by learning the drums at the young age of eight and then branching out to guitar and piano. When he was 10 years old, he started accompanying his father, the owner of artist management company Oxygen Entertainment, on the road which only grew his passion for music and live performances. Pamungkas personally crafts every aspect of his music: writing, producing, mixing & mastering, designing album artwork for each song. After having his debut album was reviewed by Kunto Aji, a top artist in Indonesia, several media outlets and music tastemakers began to name Pamungkas as an artist on the rise in 2018.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although he has been approached by many managers and labels, instead he started his own label, Maspam Records, and decided to create a path that was entirely his own. From a sold-out solo tour to headlining festivals such as We The Fest and Java Jazz 2020, he has performed on international and national stages for thousands of viewers. With now, over 1.9 million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 76 million combined views on YouTube, Pamungkas’s music has been heard all throughout Asia.</p>
